This directory serves as a local set of the split package git repos.
The build scripts will use these repos to push changes out from the mono repo.

You should remove this directory from indexing of your IDE to avoid unnecessary pain and duplicate and confusing class references.
Perhaps it makes sense to keep these outside of the main project working tree toi avoid the need to do this?
